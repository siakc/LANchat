Each node broadcasts itself at startup containing IP and nickname (via UDP)
Each of the nodes receiving the broadcasts register the broadcaster and  checks:
	If connected to two nodes->Does nothing
	If connected to no node->Connects to broadcaster (via TCP)
	If connected to one node:
		If the connected node is initiator->Connects to broadcaster
		If the connected node is not initiator->Does nothing
When a user sends a message, its node sends the message to any connected node
Other nodes relay the message
To send a message to a specific nickname, a node can establish a TCP connection o target node (using registared IP-Nickname pair)
